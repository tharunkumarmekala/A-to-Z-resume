## Running the Application

This is a static frontend application that can be run in any modern web browser. It can be served from any static file server or deployed to a hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

### API Key Requirement

To function, the application needs a valid Google Gemini API key. The application is designed to get this key in two ways:

1.  **Environment Variable:** The primary method is through an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. The hosting environment must be configured to make this key available to the application at runtime.

2.  **API Key Selector:** If the application detects an invalid or missing key (e.g., due to quota issues), it will display a prompt allowing the user to select their own API key. This functionality relies on an integration with the host platform (e.g., `window.aistudio.openSelectKey()`), making it ideal for environments like Google's AI Studio.
